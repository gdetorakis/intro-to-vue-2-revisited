# Intro to Vue 2 - Revisited

This is a project I created, based on the `Intro to Vue 2` free course provided
by [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/).

The project is a simple application presenting a `single Product page`.
I have enhanced the project with my own personal tweaks, such
as `separating the single file presented in the course to multiple files` etc.

The project is licensed under the MIT License, and you are free to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,
sublicense,
